# myPortfolio #
Hello World! This is my portfolio designed with solid foundational skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with particular attention to accessibility. Here I used my newly learned skills as a developer to ensure this portfolio is fully accessible, complete with drop-down menus and aria-labels on HTML elements for screen readers. Please be sure to visit my projects to see how I learn and grow as a developer. Stop back for updates and additional links to new projects, or even to an updated Portfolio with a new technology! Visit the About page to learn more about me. Be sure to check out my Github as I am always working on something. After you have viewed my portfolio, please contact me regarding your thoughts, feedback, or any other questions you have. Also, be sure to connect on LinkedIn!
